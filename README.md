# ReAct Model: Build an AI Agent from Scratch in Jupyter Notebook

## Overview  
This project implements a **ReAct (Reasoning + Acting) model** in a Jupyter Notebook. The ReAct framework enables AI agents to **think step-by-step**, **interact with the environment**, and **improve through feedback**.

## Features  
- **Reasoning + Acting**: Combines logical reasoning with real-world actions.  
- **Dynamic Interaction**: The agent observes, reasons, acts, and learns.  
- **AI Agent Development**: Step-by-step implementation in Python.  


## Installation  
### 1. Clone the Repository
